# quickstats

The goal of quickstats is to save some time when doing basic data anaysis with DPLYR

## Installation

You can install the released version of quickstats from [Github](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("quickstats")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(quickstats)
# figure out dependancy issue!
library(dplyr)
## basic example code
```


```{r basicsummary}
stats_summary(mtcars, mpg, cyl)
```


```{r basicpresentable}
stats_summary(mtcars, mpg, cyl)
```


In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
